Plan:

1. Get IPs on the network using https://pub.dev/packages/ping_discover_network#-readme-tab- --> https://github.com/andrey-ushakov/ping_discover_network/blob/master/lib/src/network_analyzer.dart
Q: If this is a stream then I should use stream https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html


2. After getting IPs construct widgets
-- How to do this with async data? 

3. After widgets made, redirect to previous showdialog sequence
